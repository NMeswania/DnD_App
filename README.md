Below is a table showing the MVP features of each version. This project uses semantic version of v[major].[minor].[patch].

<i>Current version: <b>v.0.0.0</b></i>

| Version | Brief Description |
|---|---|
| v0.0.0 | Nothing actually works, it's just a bunch of test code examples to try out the differen bits that will eventually go into the system (is this even called a version??) |
| v0.1.0 | Renders a full character sheet with all fields as seen in the PHB, not edittable though - what is this, a form-fillable PDF? |
| v1.0.0 | Renders a full character sheet AND all fields are editable and has basic type checking. Saves and loads different characters. Good progress, but we're not done yet! |
| v2.0.0 | Provides forms to fill in for new items, weapons, abilities, spells, features etc. Imagine if this could be look-up-able! |
| v3.0.0 | Spell browser - browse all D&D spells from the comfort of your app - which can filter by class, level, school of magic etc. No more browsing through DnD Beyond! (This is the sole reason I started this project) |
| v4.0.0+ | Who knows what the future holds? I'll be well chuffed if I get this far |
