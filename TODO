Now
- Fix pickling(?) issue in request queue

Later
- Add queue wrappers for putting/ getting from queues, no more try-excepts!!
- Figure out renderer architecture, render+logic+builder is too complicated, maybe only for the character sheet selection (completely seperate moduel maybe??)
- Re-do queues to be pipes to better handle requests and responses going to/ coming from the same source and repurpose request_handler_manager to connect pipes 
- Fix hanging on closing window
- Tests!!
